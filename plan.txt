1. akkacommitpipeline/commitserialiseractor change to pub/sub <- Done
2. commitserialisereactor responsible for creating projectors.  
how will royal mail be supplemented with commit pusher?  use a projector??   commit pusher doesnt need ordered events, it could simply subscribe to the unordered commit stream from akkacommitpipeline.  
but a projector guarantees each commit will be sent at least once.  How does the projector know which bucket it is (config?) ?  whats going to happen when there are two app instances for a bucket??

Royal mail could be more effecient if it kept track of the checkpoint in the commit store and only looked at commits > than the last time it ran, or if it looked at incremental ranges say.
